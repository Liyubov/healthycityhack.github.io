## Abstract
The hackathon is dedicated to the problem solving for city life. In particular, it is focused on the main topics, such as data science for social good, analysis of big data by citizens, such as mobility data, data about hospitals reachability etc. 
(Another topic can be developing strategies and maybe (?) also educational materials for citizens to analyze the data about their cities). One of the main motivations for the hackathon is to develop future projects between and across countries. Additionally during hackathon people can discuss with scientists and people working on urbanistic problems.
